LIST VERB = X Y ;


!Disallow verbs after determiners
!remove V IF (-1C DET) 

!The problem is that it is treating syntax as only linear
!Also the relational vs. non-relation information is not being encoded
!So while != generative is good, but what we get is less robust. 

!Consequently we can boil this down to 
!AAV, AVA, or VAA
!A can only select referent contents
!V can only select non-referent contents
!Xinkan is V-A (A) or V-A (A) {A}
